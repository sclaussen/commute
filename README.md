Each morning when I drop my son off at school he captures the date,
temperature, day of the week, and then both of our guesses in terms of
how long the commute will take.  Once we get to school, he writes down
the actual time it took, who won/lost, and then the average miles per
gallon and the average miles per hour for the commute.

The idea of this Arduino application is to automate as much of that as
possible in a single device.  The device:
- Has a start/pause, stop, and cancel buttons that are used to record the trip
- An led that indicates status (recording, paused, cancelled, stopped)
- A temperature/humidity sensor
- A date/time sensor
- A keypad to enter in the guesses
- A LCD to display all the data
- A microSD card to record each day's data
